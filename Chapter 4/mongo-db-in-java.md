## Using MongoDB with Spring

Spring Data MongoDB provides integration with the MongoDB document database. It extends the Spring Data repository abstraction to ease the implementation of MongoDB repositories. This module deals with enhanced support for MongoDB specific features and operations.

## Using MongoDB with Java Lambda

AWS Lambda allows running code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app. AWS provides a MongoDB compatible database called Amazon DocumentDB.
